## About this fork

I was playing with this fluid similuation for hours, and thought it could make for some really cool game mechanics.

e.g.

* Slither.io-style game where you "eat" the paint to grow
* Agar.io-style game where you "eat" other players to grow
* A pong-style game, where you bounce around the splat ball
* and many others

I'm currently experimenting making the splat a controllable character, via a PS4 gamepad. Most of the changes in this fork are to do with this.

If anyone wants to help out, let's create some cool stuff!
